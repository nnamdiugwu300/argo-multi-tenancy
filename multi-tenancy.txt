Create 2 clusters and authenticate your clusters to create a context in your kube config file.
make sure kubectl in installed
Make sure you can switch between the 2 clusters at will.
To see all available clusters use the command below
---
kubectl config get-contexts
---
To switch to a new context use the command below
---
kubectl config use-context $context-name
---
To view your config file use
--- 
kubectl config view
--- 
To view or kniw the cluster you are currently working on, use
---
kubectl config current-context
---
One of the cluster will be refered to as the master and the others would be refered to as the slave clusters.
ArgoCd would be installed using Helm in the master cluster
You can use the command below to install argocd in the master cluster
---
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
---
After this, you would also have to install the ArgoCd Cli in your machine.
Use the command below to install the argocd Cli
---
curl -sSL -o argocd-linux-amd64 https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest/download/argocd-linux-amd64
sudo install -m 555 argocd-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/argocd
rm argocd-linux-amd64
---
To access the argocd gui use the command below to get the password
---
argocd admin initial-password -n argocd
---
For port fowarding, use the command below, 
---
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
---
After this copy the ip and port and access on your browser.
You can login with admin as username and the initial-password generated earlier

After these steps we would sign in to argo cd using argo Cli
run the command below to login to argocd via Cli
---
argocd login 127.0.0.1:8080 --username admin
or 
argocd login argocd-nexus.camh.ca
A prompt for username and password will pop up in which you should provide.
---
Note that in the command above the ip address and port number should tally with the result of your port fowarding
if you used ingress, then make sure to input the correct ip address and port number
After running the command above a password prompt should appear, 
you should input the initial-password you just generated and the sign in should be successful.
To confirm successful login run the following commands
---
argocd app list
argocd cluster list
---

Now we have to create a new cluster or lets say, add a new cluster to our argocd
remember that argocd is installed in our master cluster
run the command below to register other clusters to argocd
---
argocd cluster add kubecluster2 --name kubecluster2
--- 
Now note that kubecluster2 is the name of the context (cluster) we want to add.
you can get the names by running the command below
---
kubectl config get-contexts
---
Also note that all the clusters(context) you want to add must be in the same kubeconfig file.
After adding the cluster successfully, some kubernetes objects would be created in your slave kubernetes kube-system namespace
objects such as Service account, a role and role binding, secrets and cluster roles and cluster role bindings.

Now to check if successful, run the command below
---
argocd cluster list
---
you will notice that a new cluster has been created. you can also  check on the gui via settings to observe the new cluster that was created.

Now its time to apply an application on argocd
note that all applications you apply must be done through the master cluster
meaning that you have to change your context back to the master cluster in other to apply any applications
Also bear in mind that the application manifest "destination" will change when you want to apply an application to the second cluster
in the destination, you have to specify the context name instead of using "in-cluster' which is the default.
in the attached manifest you will have to change "kubecluster2" to whatever your cluster name is.
I have attached a sample manifest for testing.
Enjoy!!
