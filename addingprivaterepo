To login to argocd use the command below
argocd login 20.42.101.156:32456
After the command above, a prompt will come up to input your password and username
Also, the IP address and the port numbers are incorrect so you should use more personalized addresses.
You can also use ingress (server name if you dont want to use node port)

Integrating Argocd and private repositories
For this to work first we have to sign in to our argocd cli using the above command
Run the following command to add a github private repository in your argoCD
---
argocd repo add https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps --username <username> --password <password>
In the command above you have to add the custom repository you want argo to sync with.
Also you have to specify the github username and the token which you generated from your github account
You can also do this using the UI
From settings, Navigate to repositories and then connect repo and choose HTTP
You can also use SSH for this.
